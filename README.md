  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td width="233">1.      Open the file COTININE using menu option <strong>Datasets </strong>and then <strong>Elementary Stats, 9<sup>th</sup> Edition</strong>.  This file contains some information about a collection of movies. <u>How many observations are there in this file?</u> </td>

   <td colspan="2" width="685">In this file, there are three variables, labeled Smokers, ETS, and No ETS.  The dataset was collected for a study of second-hand smoke. The sample data consists of the <u>measured serum cotinine levels</u> in three different groups of people. ·         The NOETS group lists the cotinine levels for subjects who are nonsmokers and have no exposure to environmental tobacco smoke at home or work.·         The ETS group lists cotinine levels for subjects who are nonsmokers exposed to tobacco smoke at home or work.·         The SMOKERS group lists cotinine levels for subjects who report tobacco use. Serum cotinine is a metabolite of nicotine, meaning that cotinine is produced when nicotine is absorbed by the body. Higher levels of cotinine correspond to higher levels of exposure to smoke that contains nicotine. </td>

<strong>Part IV. Hypothesis Testing</strong>

<strong> </strong>

<ol start="12">

 <li>Let’s say that you are trying to show that the level of cotinine is equal to zero (0) for people who do not smoke and are not exposed to Environmental Smoke.  Compose and test a hypothesis (use Significance of 0.01) that the cotinine levels are significantly different from 0 for the No ETS group.   Show all steps.</li>

   <td width="230">Step 2.  Determine the sample mean, sample standard deviation, and sample size.  [Hint:  You did this in an above step in this assignment.]</td>

   <td width="403"></td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td width="230">Step 3.  Determine the likelihood that the population mean is actually equal to 0 by completing a <u>Hypothesis Test: One Mean</u> in STATDISK.   Use significance of 0.01.  Paste results here.</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td width="230">Step 4.  State your conclusion.</td>

   <td width="403"><strong><u> </u></strong></td>

  </tr>

 </tbody>

</table>




<ol start="12">

 <li>Now test the claim of a tobacco company spokesmen that people in the ETS population have “positive” levels of cotinine (significantly greater than zero), suggesting that this measure is not a good indicator of exposure to tobacco smoke. Use a significance level of 0.05.</li>
